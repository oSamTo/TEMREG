 Creates MonthlyFac files from ECLIPSE emissions. With keep_old = True the
 values are only created for countries which are not in the original emep
 MonthlyFac files (from Jun2012). With keep_old = False all factors are
 from ECLIPSE (labelled "pure"). Thus, we produce:

   Timefactors/MonthlyFacs_eclipse_V6b_snap_xJune2012
   (DEPRECATED!! SNAP10 was weird!)

   Timefactors/MonthlyFacs_eclipse_V6b_snap_pure
   Timefactors/MonthlyFacs_eclipse_V6b_snap_may2021
   
 ECLIPSE has agr, agr_NH3, awb, dom,ene, flr, ind, shp, slv, tra, wst
 but slv, tra, wst have 1.0 (/nmdays) only, and awb,flr,wst very irregular

 ECLIPSE factors only created for "robust" sectors 1, 2, 3,4, and 10. For
 10 (agr) the NH3 data are from ECLIPSE agr_NH3, otherwise from agr.

 MonthlyFacs look like, e.g.:
$head MonthlyFacs.nox 
1 10    0.781   0.841   0.841   0.960   1.080   1.199   1.199   1.199   1.080   1.080   0.900   0.841
1 02    1.931   1.651   1.313   0.759   0.624   0.602   0.621   0.621   0.602   0.661   0.910   1.705
